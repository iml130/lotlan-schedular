Postion and Sensor are primtives --> They are always available and no need to have a definition

template Position
    type
end

template Sensor
    value
end



# CSV list of sensorNames (=Instances) OR!! individual
Position moldingArea_palletPlace, pos2, pos3
    type = "pallet" 
end 
<=>
Position moldingArea_palletPlace
    type = "pallet"
end 
Position pos2
    type = "pallet"
end 
Position pos3
    type = "pallet"
end 


# as above with postion, sensor could be the same
# CSV list of sensorNames (=Instances) OR!! individual
Sensor buttonMoldingArea,2,3,4
    value = boolean
end

ATTENTION: what happens, if the position can have two or more different types? e.g. pallet, box, container, ... -->?!
